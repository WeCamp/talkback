# Vision for Talkback

Our initial project ideas came from the fact that all the team members liked the
idea of the (PHP) community and the two main ideas that come with it:
- Learning
- Giving back

A brainstorming session led the team to areas such as
[Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com),
[Lonely pullrequests](http://lonelypullrequests.com) and
[Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.com). In relation to the community, and
conferences and user groups in particular, the team found that talks by speakers
was one of the main thing that connected both the learning and the giving back
part.
The team ventured into the lonely pullrequests topic for a while, adding
the concept of gamification to make sure people would want to maintain using it.
However, we found that this topic has been visited before and moved on to
actually help user groups and (new) speakers.

Some team members mentioned that it was pretty hard to find a good topic for a
talk to get into speaking. Next to that, finding a topic that would also match
the interests of user groups/conferences is even harder. We envisioned even more
things that are hard for both attendees and user group organizers:
- Food
- Locations
- Scheduling (f.e. for a user group tour)
- Website maintenance
- Sponsors/money

Gamification still remained a part of the original brainstorm that the team felt
would add more fun to the project to use and bring back users for more feedback
later on.

We decided, for the duration of the [WeCamp](http://weca.mp) timescale to focus on one single area
of development, topics for speakers in combination with badges for activity.
This lead to the creation of [User stories]().
